## Product Workshop Second Half 
In my [last post](https://tweetscape.co/blog/productupdate-06-24-2022), I ended by sharing our plan was to configure all of the “how might we” questions into compelling product offerings.
We started the second half of the structure with each team member’s presentation of their product offering. Then, we voted on each to see which of them the team agreed with most. 
After that, we compared the different pitches, picked out our alignments and misalignments, converged to a selected path, and started to plan our next steps as a team. 

## Pitches
I'll show some highlights from each team member's pitch

#### Julian 
Julian's pitch is to transform feeds into more configurable views based on a combination of sources, streams and views.

#### Ricardo 
Ricardo went with more of a landing page approach to frame his product.

#### Torba
The depth of Julian and Ricardo's pitches show why we are so excited to have them on the team. Especially when compared to my own.

#### Rhys 
Rhys was more focused on a networked view of twitter. My man loves his networks.

## Alignment
As you could likely tell, all of our pitches were aligned towards similar goals. The main pain points we all addressed were: 
1. Lack of agency 
2. Lists suck, but they are one of the only tools available to increase agency 

In this case, agency roughly means the ability to control which information is shown in your feeds.

This alignment allowed for us to quickly move on to the next section, which was deciding which persona to focus on. 

## Disagreements
The main disagreement we faced was over which persona to focus on. 

Some of the team wanted to focus on analysts, while others thought it better to build for analysts and deep thinkers simultaneously. 

The argument for analysts is that they are already extremely online, have a higher willingness to learn new tools, and have a higher willingness to pay. Plus, many deep thinkers already want to spend less time on twitter, so they are less likely to spend time learning another tool on top of twitter. 

Despite the drawbacks of building for deep thinkers, the other half of the team was in favor of the idea. Building for both would force us to keep the experience as simple, fun, and non-technical as possible, while still allowing for plenty of value to be derived. We also don’t know the full market size of either persona, so starting with both and letting feedback guide us feels like a smart play. If the solutions we build don't resonate with either group, we can re-evaluate the decision later. 

Our thinking is shown in the figure below: 

![converging paths](/ss/product-workshop-second-half/converging-paths.png)

My initial opinion was that we should focus on analysts, but I was swayed by Ricardo and Julian’s arguments to build for both. 

The green dots represent votes of the participants in the workshop. You can see that most of the team was swayed to build for both analysts and deep thinkers. Afterall, both of our [previous](https://tweetscape.co/blog/rpg-vs-research) [posts](https://tweetscape.co/blog/productupdate-06-24-2022) showed enormous overlap in JTBD for each of these personas, so it makes sense that we can likely complete those jobs with the same tool. We will find out for sure as we begin to prototype. 


## Our Selected Path
With the decision shown in the image above, we determined our selected path.

> Build a probing and surfacing app with sources, steams, and views for analysts and deep thinkers. 

This definition needs some work, but it encompasses the main point of what we are looking to build. 
The goal is to give users a stronger sense of control over their feeds, especially when they want to explore new topics without spending hours/weeks of team figuring out who to follow and what to read. 

#### Media Codes Humans

The Tweetscape team takes our information environments very seriously. We know that the information we are exposed to shapes our lives - it can enrich them or deplete them. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;the people you follow have write access to your brain&quot; -<a href="https://twitter.com/repost_offender?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@repost_offender</a> <a href="https://t.co/Xrf0Kcgs9O">https://t.co/Xrf0Kcgs9O</a></p>&mdash; Nick Torba (@nicktorba) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktorba/status/1540429673074757633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Tweetscape will be a tool that gives users more control over the media encoding they are exposed to.  

## Next Steps - Validation Plan

Now that we have a path, it is time to validate the our collective hypothesis. 
We are going to do this with a combination of illustrations, mockups, landing pages, prototypes, and background technical validation. 
Our rough validation outline is shown in the image below: 

![validation plan](/ss/product-workshop-second-half/validation-plan.png)

* Starting lofi - artifacts from the workshop, illustrations, and mockups 
    * Start work on technical validation as necessary
* Turn this into landing pages that communicate our most promising ideas 
    * Include videos and mockups of the UX 
* Move towards clickable prototypes
    * With more technical validation on the backend 

### Some Ideas and Possible Implementations

Here are some of my favorite analogies, ideas, and currently available tools in the space where we imagine tweetscape fitting in. 
Julian’s pitch above does the best job of communicating what some possible solutions look like. 

The current tools that are available that are closest to his ideas of sources, streams and views would be a combo of [Lucerne] (), where users and define “channels,” and [same.energy] (), where users are can  

**Sources**

Single tweets. This is what same.energy does, and would be similar to what you can do with spotify radio, where you can build a full playlist from a single song. 

**Streams**

Instead of relying on your follows or your lists, where any tweet from someone included is liable to show up, what if we could add some filters on top to give more control? 

**Collaborative Streams**

One of the biggest problems with lists is that they take too much work to create. Even when I downloaded and used Lucerne, I had trouble thinking of good channels to create. One of the easiest ways for me to create my own was to start by copying the ones that [Linus shared] (). 

So, what if we created a db of all the streams created by users? That way, extremely online people can create streams that others can take and make their own as they build their personal information environment. 

Earlier in my time at tweetscape, I was very excited by the idea of a curation platform. It would look a bit like a twitter focused version of [Startupy] (). 
However, one of the big hurdles is that a curation platform requires an army of curators to create the feeds that others come to look at. 
Who are those curators? Do they want the tools that we want to build? 



**Views**
We are stuck in the feed view of twitter. Even more advanced tools, like Tweetdeck, just give you fancier ways to view feeds. 
Tools like MentionMapp]() get closer, but still aren’t great.

We can also have temporal views, or relevancy views (definition up to discretion) and more. 

## What about RPG players? 
As a self-described RPG player myself, I’m a bit disappointed we don’t get to build for them. Part of the problem with RPG players is that despite their frustrations, many of them have built a workflow that works well for them. Many of the problems they face is figuring out who to talk to and what to talk about, which are less technological and curation problems and more internal and inspiration problems. 
However, I think we are going to end up finding and helping a lot of RPG curious people who have been turned off by twitter in the past because of lack of agency. Ideally, Tweetscape still turns into a tool that makes it easier for new people to begin playing the RPG because they will be able to use new streams and views to figure out the landscapes they are interested in faster.
